Lets call final assembled products "FAP"s. Write a function that inputs data frames "products_df", "parts_supp_df", 
"products_priority_df" and 
returns a dataframe with first column are FAPs. 
The second column is the calculated number of assembled products in the most optimized fashion. 
These optimized number of produced final products must be calculated via an allocation solution based on the 
data about the FAP demands and 
number and types of parts each FAP
consist of, from "products_df", and the data about supllied number of parts, from "parts_supp_df", and the data on 
proirity of allocation of parts to FAPs based on the values from "products_priority_df" in  "Priority Score" column. 
Note that the priority scores of FAPs indicates the urgency level to fullfill demands for each FAP.
